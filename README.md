🚶‍♂️ BigMood Walking
Just making a website to help map out routes for fun and learn

BigMood Walking is a fun and interactive web app that helps you plan and navigate walking routes—with a twist. It doesn’t just take your word for it when you say how far you want to walk… sometimes it challenges you to go further 💪.

🔥 Key Features:
📍 Location Choice: Use your current location or Enter a postcode to set a starting point.

🗺 Route Generation: Enter a distance (in miles or kilometers), and the app generates a loop walk route starting and ending at the same point.

🤖 Challenge Mode: When you request a route, there’s a 50% chance the app will surprise you with a cheeky message and add extra distance to your walk. you can however accept the challenge (and do the new distance) or decline and stick to your original plan.

If your input is very tiny (like 0.1 miles), the app forces a minimum walk (e.g., 1 mile) with a funny message.
If your input is huge (over 50 miles), the app skips the challenge entirely.

💬 Cheeky Motivation: motivating messages rotate when a challenge appears, keeping things playful.

🚶 Live Navigation: Follow your route with live location tracking, a clear step-by-step directions list, A progress tracker highlights your current step as you move and Celebrate with a popup when you complete the route 🎉.

🛠 How It Works: 
- Enter your desired walking distance and choose your unit (miles/kilometers).
- Select your starting point (My Location or Postcode).
- Click “Let's have it”:
- Sometimes it pops up a challenge asking you to walk further and sometimes it doesn't, haha.
- Follow your route on the map with live updates, or view step-by-step directions.

BigMood Walking keeps your routes fresh, surprising, and motivating. Whether you’re strolling or pushing your limits, we’ve got your back—and we might roast you a little along the way 😄.
